# grapemod
The repo for the grapemod for minecraft. I had been thinking about it and decided it was high time I made my own 
mod for minecraft. The primary purpose of this exercise was to familiarize myself with Java and development of 
more techincally sophisticated projects.

This mod was developed for Minecraft Java Edition v1.16.5. It also utilizes forge version 32.2.39. 
It was developed in IntelliJ studio. The MCP for the relevant version was also installed via IntelliJ.

# Useful Websites

These are the sites I utilized the most heavily during the development of this project, they've been a huge help
and I'd highly recommend them if you're looking into developing your own mod!
* [Minecraft Forge Mod Documentation](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.19.x/)
* [Modding Tutorials.org](https://moddingtutorials.org/o16/)
* [Minecraft Wiki guide to forge modding](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_Forge_mods)

# Future Work

Currently the mod compiles and that's about it, for the next few weeks my main goals are as follows:
* Item 1 - Finish implementing code base for new items
* Item 2 - Complete sprite work
* Item 3 - Finish debugging and ensure project compiles
